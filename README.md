# CryptoSignalML

## Overview

CryptoSignalML is a web-based application that generates trading signals for cryptocurrency pairs using machine learning models. It's built with Streamlit and can be accessed at [https://cryptosignalml.streamlit.app/](https://cryptosignalml.streamlit.app/).

## Features

- Supports multiple cryptocurrency exchanges
- Allows selection of various cryptocurrency pairs
- Offers multiple timeframe options for analysis
- Implements various technical indicators
- Uses machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) for signal generation
- Provides model performance metrics and confusion matrices
- Generates trading signals with entry and exit points
- Displays strategy performance metrics

## How It Works

1. **Exchange and Symbol Selection**: Users can select from available exchanges and cryptocurrency pairs.

2. **Data Fetching**: Historical price data is fetched for the selected pair and timeframe.

3. **Technical Indicators**: Users can choose from a variety of technical indicators to be calculated on the data.

4. **Machine Learning Models**: The app trains and evaluates Random Forest and XGBoost models using the prepared data.

5. **Signal Generation**: The selected model generates trading signals based on probability thresholds.

6. **Strategy Implementation**: An improved signal generation strategy is implemented, considering lookback periods and confirmation thresholds.

7. **Performance Metrics**: The app displays model performance metrics, confusion matrices, and overall strategy performance.
